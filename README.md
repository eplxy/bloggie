## How it's built
The web app is built off of a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKs2IZZya7c) by [CodingWithDawid](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithDawid).
It uses React and pure CSS on the front end, with Node.js for the backend. It's deployed through Vercel, with data management handled by MongoDB and AWS S3.
